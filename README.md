# studentRealm3.0
The web app I built is like a housing marketplace for CPUT students. It's a website where you can search and book available student accommodations near campus. On the website, you can filter the listings by location, price and gender.
To use the site, you will need to log into your student online services. Then you would need to click on Resident application, in order to be directed to the site. This is to ensure that only registered students can use the platform.

These are the following features that it has:
Accommodation: Students will be able to search for accommodations based on their budget range and other preferences such as location, provider and gender. The figure below shows where on the web application that students can search.
Accommodation Listing: The application will display a list of available accommodations that match the search criteria. They will also be able to view images of the accommodations, and apply if they are satisfied.
